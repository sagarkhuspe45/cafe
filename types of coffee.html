					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Let’s Talk Coffee Types</h3>

					<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
					<b>-</b> With the above questions in mind, consider whether you like your coffee hot or cold. It is a matter of preference, really, but there are key differences between the two brews. Hot coffee is significantly more bitter with the best aroma, for instance. Iced coffee is less acidic and offers a greater range of flavors thanks to its versatility. <br><br>

					<b>-</b> You are also less likely to burn your tongue in the mornings if you drink iced coffee, but drinking hot coffee means no potential brain freeze. <br><br>

					So here is our list of the different types of coffee drinks available today, and the types of coffee flavors we think you should try! We will also go over the types of coffee beans and types of coffee drinks!</p><br>

					<h4>- Hot Coffee Variety</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						It defintely can be very overwhelming when thinking about the many types of coffee that are available. Hot coffee, for instance, has a wide variety despite boiling down to having three common ingredients: espresso, steamed milk, and foam.</p><br>

					<h4>1. Americano</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						An Americano is a shot of espresso that is diluted with hot water and completed with a light layer of cream at the top.One of the best benefits of drinking Americanos is the lower-calorie and nonexistent fat counts compared to regular coffee.</p><br>

					<h4>2. Black Coffee</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						Black coffee is the simplest and healthiest coffee type available. The ground coffee beans are steamed by hot water within a drip machine, and that is it. Because it is served as is, the coffee will taste strong, and be at its most bitter.</p><br>

					<h4>3. Cappuccino</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						This popular drink is made by layering a balanced ratio of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam in that order. This is to ensure the cappuccinos’ bold and rich flavors, as well as to maintain its thick, foamy texture. It is common to add flavored syrups and other toppings, such as chocolate powder, to further sweeten the deal.</p><br>

					<h4>4. Espresso</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						Espresso is not necessarily a type of coffee, but a way to make coffee. The difference is the amount of water used to make espressos versus regularly brewed coffee.</p><br>

					<h4>5. Latte</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						Thanks to their versatility in customization, Lattes are among the most popular coffee choices. Anything from sweet to herbal can be added to them, and latte art can be added to complete the drink. Lattes are similar to cappuccinos because they are also made with espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam.</p>

					<h4>6. Macchiato</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						A fan favorite of coffee drinkers who enjoy the bitterness that naturally comes in coffee. There are two different ways to make this drink: more espresso than milk to make an espresso macchiato, or more milk than espresso to make a latte macchiato.</p>
						
					<h4>7. Mocha</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						Mocha, which is actually short for mochaccino, is another popular coffee variation, right up there with a latte, and for a good reason.It is a top choice when you want to satisfy your sweet tooth needs.</p>

					<h4>- Cold Coffee Variety</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						The above-addressed coffees were only examples of what hot coffees can be found at a cafe, or made at home. There are many more possibilities in that category, just as there are many possibilities in the cold coffee category. As popular as hot coffee is, especially when starting the day. Cold coffee offers benefits that can’t be disputed.</p>
						
					<h4>1. Affogato</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						Affogato technically is not a beverage, but it is still coffee-based. Affogato is actually a dessert that is meant to either be slowly sipped or enjoyed with a spoon. It is typically made with vanilla gelato or ice cream as the primary dessert and completed with a shot of hot espresso.</p>

					<h4>2. Cold-Brew</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						Cold brew coffee is a popular type of coffee all in itself, too. It is also an extremely popular type of coffee.When ready, it should taste sweeter, albeit milder, compared to other cold coffees. It is also the least acidic cold coffee.</p>

					<h4>3. Frappuccino And Frappe</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						The word. “Frappuccino’*. is trademarked by Starbucks, meaning it cannot be used by other companies.Frappuccinos are often compared to milkshakes, which is understandable. A Frappuccino is basically just an iced cappuccino that was blended into a milkshake.</p>

					<h4>4. Iced Coffee</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						There is a common belief that iced coffee is just hot coffee that has been refrigerated, and while there may be places where this actually happens, it turns out.</p>

					<h4>5. Iced Espresso</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						There are two common ways to make an iced espresso. One way to make an iced espresso is literally just making a freshly brewed espresso and letting it be chilled in the freezer to produce that cool, refreshing goodness. The other common means to create the iced espresso is to cool the freshly brewed espresso with cold milk, and then serve it with ice.</p>

					<h4>6. Iced Latte</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						An iced latte is a fairly simple drink to make, similar to an iced coffee. To make iced lattes, you just need to blend a chilled espresso drink, the desired amount of sweetener, milk, and ice.</p>

					<h4>7. Mazagran</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						Mazagrans is an interesting combination of coffee, ice. Lime juice, and water. It can be a strange experience the first time you try it. But it may quickly grow on you. Originally, the mazagran was mixed with some alcohol, such as brandy or rum. Many believe the mazagran is even the origin of iced coffee.</p>

					<h4>7. Nitro Cold Brew</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
						The nitro cold brew is similar to the original cold brew coffee, except it is made with nitrogen. This gives the coffee more of a rich, creamy finish that is reminiscent of nitro draft beers like the Guinness. Because of this, you will be greeted with a thicker, frothy texture.</p>
